# Chapter 1 - Introduction to Operating Systems

## Operating system and its functions

* An operating system (OS) is a software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.

* The primary function of an operating system is to act as an interface between the computer hardware and the user, making it easier for users to interact with the computer.

* The operating system handles a wide range of tasks, including:

    * Memory Management: The OS manages the computer's memory, including allocation of memory to different applications, tracking which parts of memory are in use and freeing up memory when it's no longer needed.

    * Process Management: The OS manages the execution of programs or processes on the computer. It schedules programs to run, manages the resources required by each program, and ensures that each process runs smoothly without interfering with other processes.

    * File System Management: The OS manages the organization, storage, and retrieval of files on a computer. It keeps track of the files and directories, maintains the file system integrity, and handles user requests to access files.

    * Input and Output Management: The OS manages the input and output devices connected to the computer, such as keyboard, mouse, printer, and monitor. It controls the flow of data between the computer and the devices and ensures that the data is transmitted and received accurately.

    * User Interface: The OS provides a user interface (UI) for the user to interact with the computer. It provides a way for users to interact with the computer using a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI).

Overall, an operating system is the backbone of any computer system. It provides a foundation on which software applications can be built and executed, and it ensures that the hardware resources are utilized effectively and efficiently.

## Evolution of Operating System (OS)

* The evolution of operating systems can be traced back to the early days of computing in the mid-20th century.

* The first computers were large and expensive machines that were used primarily for scientific and military purposes.

* The operating systems used on these machines were very simple and only provided basic functionality, such as loading and executing programs.

*  Over time, as computers became smaller, faster, and more affordable, operating systems evolved to provide more advanced features and capabilities.

* Here are some key milestones in the evolution of operating systems:

    * Batch Processing Systems: In the 1950s and 1960s, the first operating systems were designed to support batch processing. These systems were used primarily for scientific and business applications and allowed users to submit jobs to a central computer, which would process them in a batch.

    * Time-Sharing Systems: In the 1960s and 1970s, time-sharing operating systems were developed, which allowed multiple users to access a computer system at the same time. This enabled interactive computing, where users could interact with the computer in real-time.

    * Personal Computer Operating Systems: In the 1980s, personal computers became popular, and operating systems were developed specifically for these machines. Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh were two of the most popular operating systems of this era.

    * Client-Server Operating Systems: In the 1990s, client-server computing became popular, and operating systems were developed to support this model. These operating systems, such as Windows NT and Linux, allowed users to access shared resources on a network.

    * Mobile Operating Systems: In the 2000s and 2010s, mobile computing became popular, and operating systems were developed specifically for mobile devices. Examples of these operating systems include iOS and Android.

    * Cloud Operating Systems: In recent years, cloud computing has become increasingly popular, and operating systems have been developed to support this model. Cloud operating systems, such as Google Chrome OS, allow users to access applications and data stored in the cloud.

Overall, the evolution of operating systems has been driven by advances in computer hardware, changes in computing needs and paradigms, and advancements in software development techniques. Today, operating systems are critical components of virtually every computing device and play a central role in enabling a wide range of applications and services.
